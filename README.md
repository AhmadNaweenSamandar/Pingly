# Pingly
The ultimate social work-study platform for students. > Connect socially, grow professionally.

📖 About The Project
Pingly is a dual-mode platform designed to bridge the gap between social connection and professional development for university students. It addresses the isolation of studying alone while gamifying the process of professional growth.
The application features a unique Toggle Architecture that allows users to switch seamlessly between:
1. Social Mode: For finding study partners and socializing.
2. Professional Mode: For serious academic discussion, project collaboration, and reputation building.

✨ Key Features

🧩 1. Social Mode
Designed to help you find your tribe.

• 🃏 Matching Flip Cards: A Tinder-style interface where students can "Like" or "Ignore" potential matches based on study preferences, discipline, and profile bio.

• 📅 Matching Schedule: A time-based matching system. Users can broadcast their specific study schedule (e.g., "Math 101 at 2 PM") and find others available for the same task at the same time.

• 💬 Matches & Chat: A dedicated section to view your successful connections and start real-time conversations.

💼 2. Professional Mode
Designed to build your portfolio and reputation.
